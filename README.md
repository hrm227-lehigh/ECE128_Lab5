This is the repository for Cesar and Hardhik's implementation of the ECE128 Lab 5 design. This lab consisted of using two modules, an anode generator and a BCD decoder, to display multiple digits on the Basys3's multi-digit seven-segment display. To run this lab, you must have Xilinx Vivado installed. You may download these files and add the .xdc file as a design constraint. For the design source, add the file that does not contain the "_tb" designation. For the simulation source, add the file that contains the "_tb" designation. Ensure the appropriate files are enabled and disabled for running synthesis, implementation, bitstream generation, and waveform generation. When running the program, the board's 16 switches will be grouped into sections of 4: the leftmost group will control the first seven-segment, digit, the middle-left group will control the second seven-segment digit, the middle-right group will control the third seven-segment digit, and the rightmost group will control the fourth seven-segment digit. Each seven-segment digit can only display numbers 0-9, and any BCD inputs above 9 will display an "E" for error.
